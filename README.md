# BEEP-8 SDK

**BEEP-8** is a virtual retro game console designed for developing C/C++ applications. It runs on an emulated ARM v4 CPU at a fixed 2â€¯MHz and is optimized for vertical smartphone displays. The SDK adopts a two-layer architecture: at the low level, developers can directly access hardware (H/W) through minimal APIs. At the high level, developers are free to choose their own structure, frameworks, or libraries to build applications. A PICOâ€‘8â€“like C/C++ library is provided as one such option for rapid and familiar development, but it is entirely optional.

The emulator runs directly in modern web browsersâ€”Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edgeâ€”across PCs, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and virtually any platform. WebGL ensures a consistent 60â€¯fps experience, even on older devices such as the iPhone 6. As part of its roadmap, BEEPâ€‘8 is also being extended with official support for the Nintendo Switch platform.

## Features
## System Block Diagram

![BEEP-8 Block Diagram](doc/img/BEEP-8_BLOCK.png)

- **Emulated CPU:** ARM v4 running at a fixed 2 MHz.  
  - Based on an architecture originating in the mid-1990s.  
  - Compilable using GNU ARM GCC and supports C++20.

- **Memory:** Main RAM is 1Â MB and VRAM is 128Â KB (shared for BG and sprite patterns, 4Â bpp, 512Ã—512).

- **ROM Limit:** Maximum size is **1024 KB** per game.

- **PPU (Pixel Processing Unit):** Handles all rendering operations including background layers, sprites, and shape drawing.  
â€“ Drives the 128Ã—240 pixel display using a fixed 16-color palette.  
â€“ Shares access to 128â€¯KB of VRAM with both BG and sprite patterns (4â€¯bpp, 512Ã—512 layout).

- **APU (Audio Processing Unit):** Emulates a Namco C30-style sound engine.  
â€“ Supports 8 audio channels with real-time synthesis.  
â€“ Provides retro-style sound effects and music playback.

- **HIF (Human Interface):** Fully supports keyboard, mouse, and **touch inputs** via a dedicated HIF module.
â€“ Converts browser input events into system-level signals.  
â€“ Ideal for both PC and mobile web environments.

- **TMR (Timer Module):** Provides high-precision system timing for scheduling and interrupts.  
â€“ Drives periodic system tasks at a consistent 60â€¯Hz tick rate.  
â€“ Integrated with the custom RTOS (`b8OS`) for real-time operations.

- **Custom RTOS (`b8OS`):**  
  - A lightweight real-time operating system that supports multi-threading, semaphores, interrupt handlers, and a simple in-memory file system.  
  - Designed to provide a minimal set of UNIX-like APIs tailored for game development.  
  - Enables asynchronous components, such as sound drivers operating independently from the main thread, to be implemented with ease.
  - Its architecture allows developers to focus on gameplay logic without dealing with complex OS-level implementation details.

- **Development Environment:**  
  - Advanced developers can directly control virtual hardware components (e.g., PPU, APU, I/O registers).  
  - Alternatively, a PICO-8-like C/C++ library is available for rapid development.  
  - All C/C++ source code is fully open and available for modification.

- **Distribution:**  
  - Completed games are delivered as a single ROM file.  
  - Developers can release their games on the official BEEPâ€‘8 portal site: [https://beep8.org](https://beep8.org)  
  - The portal serves as a shared space where everyone can upload, discover, and play games created by the community.

- **Cost:**  
  - The SDK is completely free to use, and game releases are free as well.

## Quick Start

You can get started with the SDK in one of the following ways:

- **Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended for Git Users)**  
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:beep8/beep8-sdk.git

- **Option 2: Download as a .tar.gz Archive (No Git Required)
  Download the latest SDK source code directly as a .tar.gz file:
  https://github.com/beep8/beep8-sdk/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
  This is ideal for users who prefer not to use Git. On macOS and Linux, the archive can be extracted with built-in tools.
  ðŸ’¡ Tip: On Windows, we recommend using 7-Zip to extract .tar.gz archives safely.

2. **Build a Sample Application:**
    BEEPâ€‘8 applications are built by directly manipulating the virtual hardware registers in C/C++. 
    There is no predefined frameworkâ€”developers can code in any style using custom libraries or modules.
    Full support up to C++20, including the STL, means that most existing C++ libraries can be
    built and run on BEEPâ€‘8.

    At the same time, we also provide a PICOâ€‘8â€“style sample library for developers familiar with PICOâ€‘8 game development to use.
    Navigate to the SDK directory and run make:
    ```bash
    cd ./beep8-sdk/sdk/app/pico8_example
    make clean
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Emulator:**
   In your terminal, change to the example directory and run:
   
   ```bash
   cd ./beep8-sdk/sdk/app/pico8_example
   make run
   ```

   This command launches the built BEEPâ€‘8 ROM (`b8rom`) in your default web browser. BEEPâ€‘8 uses Google Chrome by default, so ensure Chrome is installed on your system.
   
   > **Note:** In BEEPâ€‘8, output from `printf()` is not rendered onâ€‘screenâ€”it appears in the debug console (the log panel on the right side of the emulator UI).

## API Documentation

For complete API details, please refer to the header files in the `include/` directory. Key headers include:
- **pico8.h:** Defines the high-level API for graphics, sound, and input.
- **Other headers:** Provide low-level interfaces for the PPU, APU, and RTOS (`b8OS`).

---

## Sample Application

Below is a minimal "Hello World" sample that demonstrates a BEEP-8 application:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <beep8.h>

int main(void) {
  // Print debug output; on BEEP-8, printf() output is sent to the
  // emulator's debug console (visible on the side) rather than on-screen.
  printf("hello BEEP-8\n");
  return 0;
}
```

> **Note:** Although this sample exits immediately after printing, it serves as the simplest example to illustrate how to compile and run a BEEP-8 application.
